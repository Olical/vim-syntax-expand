# vim-syntax-expand

This contains functions to expand a character to a string as long as your cursor isn't currently inside a string or comment syntax element. This essentially allows you to have single character abbreviations that only apply to actual syntax. Please check the doc directory for more information.

Here's how I use it with conceal in JavaScript to create a cute language on top of JavaScript that doesn't affect anyone else.

## Installation

Use your favourite plugin manager, you know the drill. I like [vim-plug][], so here's how you'd install it with that.

```vim
Plug 'Wolfy87/vim-syntax-expand'
```

## Usage

Here's my example configuration for JavaScript. The conceal functionality is provided by [vim-javascript][] (which is fantastic).

```vim
" Map the conceal characters to their expanded forms (only for javascript files)
autocmd FileType javascript inoremap <silent> <buffer> @ <C-r>=syntax_expand#expand("@", "this")<CR>
autocmd FileType javascript inoremap <silent> <buffer> # <C-r>=syntax_expand#expand("#", ".prototype.")<CR>
autocmd FileType javascript inoremap <silent> <buffer> < <C-r>=syntax_expand#expand_head("<", "return")<CR>

" Keeps everything concealed at all times. Even when my cursor is on the word.
set conceallevel=1
set concealcursor=nvic

" JavaScript thanks to pangloss/vim-javascript
let g:javascript_conceal_function = "Î»"
let g:javascript_conceal_this = "@"
let g:javascript_conceal_return = "<"
let g:javascript_conceal_prototype = "#"
```

So now when I type `@` it is actually expanded to `this` but I still see it as `@`. Cool, right? This will work for other languages too, you just need to set up your conceal rules (there's usually a plugin) and some expansion bindings.
